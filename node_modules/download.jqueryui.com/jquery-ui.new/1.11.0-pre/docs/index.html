<p>jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects,
	widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library.
	If you're new to jQuery UI, you might want to check out our
	<a href="http://jqueryui.com/" title="jQuery UI">main site</a> for
	more information and full demos. If you're new to jQuery, you might
	also be interested in the <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/">Learn jQuery</a>
	tutorials.</p>

<p>This site provides API documentation for jQuery UI 1.9. If
	you're working with jQuery UI 1.8, you can find the API documentation
	on <a href="http://api.jqueryui.com/1.8/">api.jqueryui.com/1.8/</a>.
	However, we would encourage you to upgrade to jQuery UI 1.9 in order
	to receive the best support and take advantage of recent bug fixes
	and enhancements. Check out the
	<a href="http://blog.jqueryui.com/2012/10/jquery-ui-1-9-0/">release announcement</a>
	and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/">upgrade guide</a>
	to find out more about jQuery UI 1.9.</p>

<p>To get started, use the search at the top of the page, view the
	<a href="/category/all/">full listing of entries</a>, or browse by
	category from the sidebar.</p>

<p>jQuery UI 1.9 supports jQuery 1.6 and newer.</p>
